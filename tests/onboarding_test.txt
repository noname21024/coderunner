   - Step 1: anchors to `#game-controls` with message about choosing language and mode.
   - Step 2: anchors to `#typing-container` with message about starting typing.
   - Step 3: anchors to `footer` with message about sharing and replay.
4. Verify the tooltip background is dark and buttons are indigo, skip is a small '✕' at top-right.
