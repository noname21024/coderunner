# typingrunner — Introduction

typingrunner is a focused, developer-oriented typing playground built for programmers who want to improve speed, accuracy, and muscle memory while working with real code.

Target audience
- Developers of all levels who want to practice typing real programming language syntax (JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.) instead of natural language.
- Students and bootcamp attendees preparing for coding interviews or improving typing efficiency while coding.

Goals & Objectives
- Improve code-centric words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy while typing code snippets.
- Help players internalize common patterns, keywords, and indentation habits found in real codebases.
- Offer quick practice sessions that fit into short developer workflows (no lengthy setup required).

Is it fun?
- Yes — typingrunner focuses on short, satisfying tests, multiple modes, visible performance feedback (WPM, accuracy, combo), and easy restart to keep practice playful.
- Players can enjoy the challenge of typing realistic code and seeing measurable progress over repeated sessions.

How to play (brief)
1. Choose a language and lesson (short code snippets or small functions).
2. Pick a mode and time limit (Standard, Time Attack, Sudden Death).
3. Focus on typing the code that appears in the test area; errors impact accuracy and combo.
4. Stop when the timer ends and review your WPM, accuracy, and errors.
